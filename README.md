This script is designed (roughly needs work, i threw it together in about an hour) To pull files out of PCAP files.

Currently it will give everything but .doc files as unkown file extensions.  as I figure more out, i will add them to the get_extension function.

The pcap that is included is zipped with the password 'infected'.  I cannot take credit for it, im just using it as a test pcap but it comes from malware-traffic-analysis.net

(thank you for the PCAP).

If you have other pcaps you would like to try on this let me know.  I havent tried having it pull a text document yet its on my list of things to do.
